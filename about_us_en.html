    <h2>ABOUT US</h2>

    <h3>Termez University of Economics and Service</h3>
    <h4>An Academic Profile</h4>
    <p>Termez University of Economics and Service (TUES) is a dynamic and forward-looking higher education institution
      in Uzbekistan, strategically located in Termez, a city that historically functioned as a cultural and intellectual
      crossroads of Central Asia. As a private university dedicated to excellence in teaching, research, and community
      engagement, TUES is committed to preparing future leaders in economics, business, the social sciences, applied
      sciences, and professional service industries. Since its establishment, the university has strived to combine
      rigorous academic programs with practice-oriented training, while simultaneously cultivating a global vision
      through partnerships with distinguished institutions worldwide.</p>
    <br>
    <p>TUES now stands as one of the region’s most innovative educational institutions, recognized for integrating local
      and international perspectives in its curricula, advancing sustainable development practices, and providing its
      students with opportunities to participate in the international academic community. It is in this spirit of global
      intellectual exchange that the university hosts the international student symposium entitled “The World in 2050”,
      where students, academics, and professionals converge to explore challenges and opportunities shaping humanity’s
      shared future.</p>
    <br><br>

    <h4>Academic Mission and Vision</h4>
    <p>The central mission of TUES is to nurture critical, creative, and globally competent graduates capable of
      contributing to the socio-economic transformation of Uzbekistan and beyond. The university’s vision is rooted in
      three guiding principles:</p>
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Excellence in Education:</strong> Providing high-quality, research-driven, and interdisciplinary
        programs across
        economics, business, management, social sciences, linguistics, and applied fields.</li>
      <li><strong>Global Integration:</strong> Promoting cross-cultural understanding and knowledge transfer through
        international
        partnerships and exchange initiatives.</li>
      <li><strong>Sustainable Development:</strong> Advancing innovation in renewable energy, digital transformation,
        and
        community-oriented services that address pressing societal needs.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>Through these principles, TUES not only equips its students with the necessary academic knowledge but also
      instills a sense of social responsibility and entrepreneurial spirit, preparing them to respond to complex global
      challenges.</p>
    <br><br>

    <h4>Academic Programs and Facilities</h4>
    <p>TUES offers a diverse range of academic programs that reflect the growing demands of both local and international
      labor markets. Its core disciplines include economics, management, finance, business administration, linguistics,
      and information technology, supported by specialized training in service industries. Moreover, the university
      integrates practical experience into its academic structure. For example, TUES operates its own medical clinic,
      enabling students in medical and service-oriented fields to acquire hands-on skills while simultaneously serving
      local communities.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Research and data-driven decision-making are further supported by the university’s access to advanced facilities
      such as the Bloomberg Terminal, a tool widely used in leading global universities and financial institutions. This
      infrastructure enables faculty and students to engage in real-time economic forecasting, market analysis, and
      applied research projects with direct relevance to both industry and public policy.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Additionally, the university invests heavily in sustainable energy initiatives. Its solar energy infrastructure
      not only contributes to reducing environmental impact but also allows the university to supply clean energy to
      regional institutions, positioning TUES as a pioneer of green transformation within Uzbekistan’s higher education
      landscape.</p>
